# Sensor-Data-System
<center><h3>Goal ðŸŽ¯: To stimulate a basic sensor system setup</h3></center>

I made a mock data(like passenger movement in zones) which will be used throughout the project
- Load and Clean it 
- validate it 
- visualize it 
- Making a report on the System setup & Validation 
- Make a jira ticket 
- Save the work
